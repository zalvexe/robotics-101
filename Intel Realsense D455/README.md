## how to use it
to test out whether the driver is working, you can use ```realsense-viewer``` and sometimes there's some rules.d conflict if you try to install by source and by pkg. To counter this issue, delete the udev rules in ```/etc/udev/rules.d``` BUT if you got a problem of udev rules not found, you can add it yourself :)
